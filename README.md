## Business Activities:

  - Aims to increase the speed and reduce the cost of transferring money between financial institutions

### Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers? -- 
  - Financial institutions

### What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
  - Cross-currency transactions via XRP ledger to reduce time (3-5 seconds) and at a negligible cost
  - Current transaction speed for institutions without the ledger is *much* slower and with a sizeable cost

### Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
  - Ripple Protocol (RTXP) -- blockchain to facilitate transactions
  - Ripple Consensus Ledger -- open-source cryptographic ledger powered by a P2P network of nodes
  - xRapid -- on-demand liquidity solution that allows financial institutions to exchange value between fiat currencies through a network that uses XRP as a bridge currency for its liquitiy
  - Variety of APIs to help nodes and other third parties to interact with the ledger


## Landscape:

### What domain of the financial industry is the company in?
  - Blockchain/Cryptocurrency
  - Payments and Remittance

### What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?
  - Exponential adoption of blockchain technology across every financial sector
  - Distributed ledgers essentially invalidating traditional transaction methods
  - Removing third parties and evolving to a trustless system via blockchain
  - Decentralized finance has allowed individuals to become their own banks and access financial, social, political protocols (to name a few) that wouldn't otherwise be available (lending/borrowing, liquidity protocols, etc.)
  - Stablecoins have offered alternatives to fiat and have prompted the development of CBDCs
  - P2P payment systems have evolved quickly, but institutional adoption has yet to fully blossom

### What are the other major companies in this domain?
  - Swift
  - Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Stellar, Litecoin, Dogecoin
  - Blockchains -- IBM, Azure, Oracle
  - Quorum

## Results

### What has been the business impact of this company so far?
  - Multiple corridors have been opened for XRP to do cross-border remittance
  - Contracts signed with 300+ banks globally
  - Reduced transaction speed and fees
  - Alternative liquidity solutions for financial institutions

### What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics? How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?
  - Market cap -- XRP has been a top 10 cryptocurrency by market cap for years, currently #8; mcap is currently $82.49B, of which XRP accounts for $38.6B
  - Price of XRP -- directly correlated to market cap; currently priced at $0.818
  - Settlement speed -- a key element in Ripple's design, as transactional speed is in dire need of an upgrade; a transaction currently takes 4.0 seconds globally using Ripple's ledger as opposed to the 5 minute to 24 hour window that Swift (Ripple's biggest competitor) boasts domestically and between 2 and 5 business days internationally
  - Network Transaction Fee -- another key element in Ripple's design, as transfers both domestic and globally can become costly; the current network transaction fee with Ripple is $0.002, whereas Swift's transfer fees are generally between $25 and $30 domestic and $45-50 internationally
  - XRP itself holds its own as a currency and Ripple's ledger system is unquestionably a better solution for financial institutions as far as enhanced speed, cost, and efficiency

## Recommendations

### If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

### Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

### What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

### Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
